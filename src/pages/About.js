        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          At ZeroTrust Blockchain, we're redefining security paradigms by combining the 
          Zero Trust security model with blockchain technology. Our mission is to create 
          an infrastructure where security is built-in by design, not added as an afterthought.

        <h2>What is Zero Trust?</h2>
        <p>
          Zero Trust is a security concept based on the principle of "never trust, always verify." 
          It requires all users, whether inside or outside the organization's network, to be 
          authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated before being granted access to 
          applications and data.

        <h2>Our Technology</h2>
        <p>
          Our platform leverages advanced cryptographic techniques, distributed ledger technology, 
          and smart contracts to create a seamless yet highly secure environment. By tokenizing 
          access rights and recording authentication events on an immutable blockchain, we eliminate 
          traditional vulnerabilities while maintaining complete auditability.
